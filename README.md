 </p>
Recompiled port of Test Drive Unlimited (TDU) 2006 XBOX 360. 

## Why we should work on it?
I have a wish to return the amazing moments, when we was young.
When I was a child it was one of my favourite games, but when I hadn't been enough competent in PC, due to I hadn't played online mode,
but when I remembered about this game, it was to late, servers was closed...
I think, what I'm not alone with this wish...
Now I'm a programmer (in specialities of C++ 3D graphics and nets) and I've no through out this idea out of my mind. 
Then, I'll try to close this goal.

## Advantages of this project:
1)We can understand how works online mode and remake servers for PC and XBox 360

2)Easier and better modding with understanding of source code

3)Port of this game to Mac and Linux (later)

4)Possibility to create global mods for PC and XBox verison 

5)360-version have some new cars, which we are easier to convert to PC-version (and add new cars)

6)360 Graphics sometimes a bit better, due to special shaders (like mw 360 vs PC version)

7)Sequel maybe modified (at this moment fan-made online is not exist on XBOX 360 version, only on PC and PS3 versions) 

In conclusion, we will add 4K, RTX, DLSS and etc. cool modern things and solve the problems with online, traffic AI and CPU-usage

**This project is not a replacement for the game (you still need to own a legal copy of the game); and does not provide any game assets!**
**You should dump your DVD and prepare for this port**

XenonRecompUnlimited - it's special fork of XenonRecomp for TDU engine, like experimental fork-version with fresh updates
 (unfortunattely at this moment XenonRecomp updates long-term :( )

## Project 
Windows 10,11 (32/64)bit
DirectX12+SDL3 C++ 32bit(XenonRecomp target recomp:)

(also Vulkan+SDL3 64bit, but a bit later (and maybe Rust as alternative language), but not soon ?earlier than XenonRecomp will recompile for MacOS and Linux)

**If you specialist in Vulkan, Vulkan pipeline would be greatly appreciated (XenosRecomp suppor tboth recomp to DX12 and Vulkan shaders)**

Goals of the project 

1)kickstart recompiled version

2)convert recompiled machine C++ to "readable" C++

3)understand the net-code and make new server

4)add new graphics

## Project Status
Work in progress.

## Build instructions
As usual for XenonRecompile projects

## Future
If project will be finished next we continue modify(invent some features from sequel) and port 
this to other platforms and maybe will work on sequel

## P.S.
**We know, that some other TDU fans works on their clients (OpenTDU): https://github.com/opentestdriveunlimited/opentdu **
**It'll be good try to co-op in this labor, but It's interesting to try to solve this problem in different ways.**
